# Deep Compressive Autoencoder for Large-Scale Spike Compression

The repository contains source codes for the paper *Deep Compressive Autoencoder for Action Potential
Compression in Large-Scale Neural Recording* in submission to *Journal of Neural Engineering*.

[Pytorch 0.4.0](https://pytorch.org/) is required to run the model.

The idea of compressing neural spikes using deep autoencoder embedding vector quantization is inspired by the awesome work [*Neural Discrete Representation Learning*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937) by Aaron van den Oord.
