# Deep Compressive Autoencoder for Large-Scale Spike Compression

The repository contains source codes for the paper *Deep Compressive Autoencoder for Action Potential
Compression in Large-Scale Neural Recording* in submission to *Journal of Neural Engineering*.

[Pytorch 0.4.1](https://pytorch.org/) is required to run the model. An Nvidia GPU supporting CUDA 9.0 is needed.

The idea of compressing neural spikes using deep autoencoder embedding vector quantization is mainly inspired by the recent work [*Neural Discrete Representation Learning*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937) by Aaron van den Oord *et al*.
